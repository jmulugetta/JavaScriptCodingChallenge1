//VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”

var num1 = 10;
var num2 = 6;
var diff = (num1 - num2);

console.log ('The difference between ' + num1 + ' and ' + num2 + ' is ' +diff);
